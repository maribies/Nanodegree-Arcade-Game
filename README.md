## Overview

This is a game developed for the Udacity Front End Nano Degree program to practice writing object-oriented functions.  See  [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric)

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How to Play
Upon loading, the player may use the arrow keys to move the character. The object of the game is to get the character to the water without hitting any of the enemy bugs. The score is kept track above the game board, with the player achieving one point each time they reach the water. The player loses a point if they hit an enemy bug. The player wins the game when they've reached the water 3 times.

## How to Run
To run:
1. Download or clone the GitHub file to your local
2. Open the index.html file from the download in your browser
